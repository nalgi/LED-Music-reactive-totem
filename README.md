# LED-Music-reactive-totem

This is the code for a music reactive totem using the FastLED library. You can find some pictures and videos of it as well. It produces three different light spectrums that move along the LED strip. You can adjust the sensitiviy with a potentiometer. You can put it in some handicraft wool and it looks like a thunderstorm cloud.
Attached to a telescopic rod it is a blast at festivals! Plus, it is much easier to find your friends again when you lost them in the crowd.
